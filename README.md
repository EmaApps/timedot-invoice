# timedot-invoice

WIP: `nix run`-generate your invoice from [hledger timedot](https://hledger.org/time-planning.html) file.

- Write your own HTML (heist template) and CSS, with a default one generated automatically.
- Make full use of [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/)'s hot reload, for a live view of invoice.
- Simple. Does one thing, and one thing only. No kitchen sink. "Print to PDF" if you want PDF.
